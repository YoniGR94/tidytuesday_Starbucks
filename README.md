# tidytuesday_Starbucks
**Still in progress.**

In this project, I used the [Starbucks drink menu dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-12-21) and tried to predict how much calories is there in any drink. This is my first try to use data from the [Tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. This data was published in 21/12/2021.

For those of you who are not familiar with this project, it has a weekly open data set that can be called from Github and manipulated, for example, for data visualisation or prediction modeling.

parnship and tydiverse where my main friends here, and with some other packages they helped me to make my best for people who want to enjoy some coffe and save some calories (or gain some...).
